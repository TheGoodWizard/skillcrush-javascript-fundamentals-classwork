# skillcrush-javascript-fundamentals-classwork

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my classwork from The SkillCrush Bootcamp; JavaScript Fundamentals course.  I created this repository in order to demonstrate
the work I've been doing over the past few weeks, as that work is not currently reflected on my gitHub profile and instead shows about 3 weeks worth of 'codeless-days'.
